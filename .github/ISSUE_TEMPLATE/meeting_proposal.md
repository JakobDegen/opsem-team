# Comment policy

These issues are meant to be used as an "announcements channel" regarding the proposal, and not as a
place to discuss the technical details. Feel free to subscribe to updates. We'll post comments when
reviewing the proposal in meetings or making a scheduling decision. In the meantime, if you have
questions or ideas, ping the proposers on [Zulip] (or elsewhere).
