## Meetings

Team meetings are currently held every Tuesday at noon, Boston time. You can see what time that is
in your timezone [here](https://everytimezone.com/s/53a200c0). The meetings take place on jitsi:
<https://meet.jit.si/ucg-rust>.

On the third Tuesday of every month we skip our regular meeting in exchange for asynchronous
planning. During this time, we pick meeting topics for the upcoming timeslots from our pool of open
[meeting proposals]. Upcoming meetings are listed below.

[meeting proposals]: https://github.com/rust-lang/opsem-team/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ameeting-proposal

Anyone with a topic that they would like to see covered should feel free to [file a
proposal][meeting template].

[meeting template]: https://github.com/rust-lang/opsem-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=meeting-proposal&template=meeting_proposal.md&title=%28My+meeting+proposal%29

Meetings will typically have a champion - someone responsible for driving the meeting and preparing
any design documents to read. This person will typically be the same person that wrote the proposal
(although that is not a hard requirement). Additionally, someone will be given the responsibility of
taking notes.
